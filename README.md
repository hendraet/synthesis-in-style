![sis_example_high](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16731894/177955150-0e233fe0-4bd5-4ad9-88e4-2d1c2462755e.png)
This repository contains the code for the paper [Synthesis in Style: Semantic Segmentation of Historical Documents using Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06777).
The trained models and benchmark dataset used for evaluation can be found [here](https://bartzi.de/research/synthesis_in_style).

## Installation

Make sure that Python (version >= 3.8) is installed.

In `stylegan_code_finder` directory execute: 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

For building the required cuda extensions `ninja` is required. (Installation under Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install ninja-build`) 

## Docker Image

You can also find a docker image with all necessary dependencies on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hendraet/synthesis-in-style).
